    JavaScript - Primitive Data Types

    The following exercise contains the following subjects:
        * String
        * undefined

    Instructions:
        * String Tasks:
            1) Write the phrase "Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp" as a String in 5 different ways.
                    const str1 = 'Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp';
                    const str2 = "Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp";
                    const str3 = `Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp`;
                    const str4 = String('Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp');
                    const str5 = new String('Welcome to Full-Stack Bootcamp');

            2) Get the first letter of the word "Bootcamp" using two different ways.
                const letter1 = 'Bootcamp'.charAt(0);
                const letter2 = 'Bootcamp'[0];
            
            3) Write two string variables with the same word, in a way that when compared will result in false.
                const differentStr1 = 'Hello';
                const differentStr2 = new String('Hello');
            
            4) Get the length of the String from the first task.
                const str1Length = str1.length;
            
            5) Combine these two Strings "Hello" and "World" using as many different ways you can (at least 3).
                const hello = 'Hello';
                const world = 'World';
                const result1 = 'Hello' + 'World';
                const result2 = 'Hello'.concat('World');
                const result3 = `${hello} ${world}`;


        * undefined Tasks:
            1) Create an undefined variable in two differnet ways.
                const undef1;
                const undef2 = undefined;

            2) Check if a variable is undefined in two differnet ways.
                undef1 === undefined;
                typeof undef1 === 'undefined';
